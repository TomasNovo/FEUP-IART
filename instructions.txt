This project was programmed using the .NET framework with C++/CLI for the GUI, which compiles on Visual Studio.
To run the program you need the .NET framework. The binary is in the 'x64/Release' folder along with the necessary images.
To compile the project you need to install Visual Studio if you don't have it and import the project. After sucessfully running the program you will be presented with a graphical interface with 4 players.
You can select if you want a specific character to be a player, a bot ou out of the game.
To start playing choose the character roles, press the reset button and then the player button.
The first player character starts the game.
If the game has no players (only bots) the first bot in the clock-wise motion starts, starting at the red character.
A move is either physically moving a character (wasd keys) or placing a barrier by clicking in an empty space on the GUI.
You can also specify the limit and/or the heuristic function of the algorithm, if it needs it.
